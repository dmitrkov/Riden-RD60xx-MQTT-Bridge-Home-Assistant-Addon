# Riden RD60xx MQTT Bridge Home Assistant Add-on

Bridge for Riden RD60xx power supplies that exposes status and controls over MQTT.
It works with the **standard Riden WiFi module** out of the box. **No flashing, no hardware mods, no firmware changes required**.

---

## What it does

- Accepts TCP connections from the Riden PSU (default port 8080)
- Publishes status to MQTT
- Provides control via MQTT (output, voltage, current, OVP/OCP, etc.)
- Automatically adds Home Assistant MQTT Discovery entities

---

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant with the **MQTT integration** enabled
- **Mosquitto broker add-on** installed and running

---

## Installation

### 1) Add this repository to Home Assistant

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDetFisch%2FRiden-RD60xx-MQTT-Bridge-Home-Assistant-Addon)

### 2) Install the add-on

- Find **Riden RD60xx MQTT Bridge Home Assistant Add-on** in the add-on store
- Install

### 3) Configure and start

- Open the add-on settings
- Configure MQTT (defaults work with Mosquitto)
- **Start the add-on**

If MQTT Discovery is enabled, entities will appear automatically in Home Assistant.

---

## Configuration (optional)

Minimal (Mosquitto defaults):

```yaml
mqtt_host: core-mosquitto
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_username: ""
mqtt_password: ""
mqtt_prefix: riden
mqtt_discovery_enabled: true
```

---

## WiFi Provisioning Tool (optional)

If your PSU WiFi module is not yet configured to connect to your Home Asisstant IP, use the provisioning tool:

### Tool location

```text
riden_wifi_provision.py
```

### Requirements

- Python 3 on **Windows / Linux / macOS**
- The machine running the tool must be connected to the **same 2.4 GHz WiFi** you want the PSU to join

### Usage

```bash
python riden_wifi_provision.py
```

You will be asked for:

- **Server IP**: The IP the PSU should connect to after setup (use your Home Assistant IP)
- **SSID** and **Password** of your 2.4 GHz WiFi
- Optional **BSSID** (AP MAC address)

After provisioning, the PSU connects to your WiFi Router and then to the **server IP** you entered (Home Assistant).

### Example with CLI commands (alternative)

```bash
python riden_wifi_provision.py --server-ip 192.168.1.50 --ssid "MyWiFi" --password "secret" --bssid "b8:c1:ac:a6:35:93"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure MQTT is reachable and credentials are correct
- Ensure the PSU WiFi module is in the correct setup mode before provisioning
